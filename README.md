# Summary

I want to build an application that is basically an enhanced clipboard.  
The application will be packaged via docker and will run on a VPS of mine.  
(It should be made possible to self-host it though)  

In the future I want to create several clients for this.  
I plan to create:  
- A CLI written in Rust
- A mobile App written in Kotlin
- A minimal web frontend

But for now this will stay a big work in progress, and I will be starting with the server side.
