# TheMover

This project will be a continuation of a previous attempt called "File_Switcher".  
The previous app was an app for windows, that was meant to cut down on the time it takes to move a certain Set of files from one folder to another.  
Its a weird problem but one i had to face none the less.  

The last project was a WPF-App for Windows, and i dropped it because it was a little to much overhead to work with it.  
I will try to cut down on that by creating "TheMover" as a Console application.  

I will also apply some lessons learned from the previous project and just see where it goes.
